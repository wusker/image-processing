# Sharp Personal Image Processor

Local drag and drop image processor that resizes and optimizes images for use on the web.

Built with: Node, Express, Multer, and Sharp.

Currently statically set to run on localhost:5500 with server @ localhost:9090. Change this configuration for your own needs.

```
yarn

yarn serve
```

## Future

The hope is to optimize this system for an efficient workflow and optimized images closer to how [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) handles image this process—but this with bulk processing.
